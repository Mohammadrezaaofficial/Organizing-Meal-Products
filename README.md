# Organizing-Meal-Products

## Summary
The document outlines a project to create multiple meal deals for different shops by combining their top-selling and least-selling products. The main goals are to promote less popular items, increase product variety for customers, and boost the overall value of orders. The document details the initial steps of a data science workflow, including importing libraries and creating a sample dataset with pricing information.

## 1. Importing Libraries:
The project begins by importing essential Python libraries for data analysis and visualization, including pandas, numpy, matplotlib.pyplot, seaborn, and itertools.

## 2. Creating a Sample Dataset: 
A simulated dataset is created to mimic real customer order data. The dataset includes four fictional shops: "Pizza Hub," "Sushi World," "Burger Town," and "Healthy Bites," each with a predefined list of food items and randomly generated prices.

## 3. Organizing Meal Deals: 
The file states the project's core purpose is to organize meal deals by combining "Top N best-selling products" with "Bottom M least-selling products". Each deal would have a suggested price based on historical pricing. This is the problem the notebook aims to solve.

## Conclusion
The document successfully establishes the problem and the initial setup for organizing meal deals, including creating a simulated dataset for a specific business use case. However, based on the provided content, it does not show the actual implementation of the logic for selecting the top and bottom-selling items or the final creation and visualization of the meal deals. Therefore, the file acts as a foundational document for the project but does not present the final results of the analysis.
